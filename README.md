# Algorithm Efficiency Mini-Project

## Overview
This project implements and analyzes the efficiency of classical algorithms:
- Fibonacci (Naïve Recursive, Dynamic Programming)
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Binary Search

We measure **execution time** and **memory usage** using Python’s `time` and `memory_profiler`, and visualize results with `matplotlib`.

---

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in **Google Colab** or locally with Jupyter.
2. Install required packages:
   pip install matplotlib memory_profiler
